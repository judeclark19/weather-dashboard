# Weather Dashboard
Use this simple weather app to view the current weather conditions, as well as a 5-day forecast, for the city of your choice. Simply type in the name of a city and click "Search" to view the weather data.

Your search history will populate on the left side of the page. Click on a search history item to view the weather for that city again. Click the "Clear" button to clear your search history.
